# 690-Final-Project Andres Quinonez 916149044


Want to make a weather app that is nice and minimalistic and i want to undertake this project in order to really familiarize myself with json decoding and using api in order to retrieve data. I am working individually here and my project is adapted from the online class i enrolled Udemy named iOS 13 & Swift 5

My features that I want:
Must have:
-A location button that when clicked will find your location and give you the weather of that location.
-Search bar that allows you to search the city where you want the weather and returns live weather data in real time. 

**NOTE**
had difficulty implementing and getting data when the city had a space like for example "New York" but was able to get it down to some degree.

-Mutable icons that will change depending on the type of weather in the searched city
-Location weather that is retrieved upon opening application.
-A button that will change from farenheight to celsius.

I have implemented all the must have features.
